Photobox is a Photo Booth clone that runs in the browser. We built it in four hours with Claude. It captures your camera feed, runs it through GPU shader effects in real-time, and lets you take photos and record video. 18 effects across two tabs, 3x3 live preview grid, persistent gallery.

The interesting part is how the camera gets into the shader pipeline. The browser's ``getUserMedia`` API gives you a ``<video>`` element. Noisemaker's ``CanvasRenderer`` can accept any image source as an external texture. The bridge between them is one call per frame:

.. code-block:: javascript

    this._renderer.updateTextureFromSource('imageTex_step_0', this._videoSource)

That's it. The render loop calls this in ``requestAnimationFrame``, uploading the current video frame to the GPU. The DSL program handles the rest. Every effect in Photobox is a one-line DSL string:

.. code-block:: text

    media().bulge().write(o0)
    media().grade(preset: noir).write(o0)
    media().celShading(mix: 0.75, edgeThreshold: 0.25).write(o0)
    media().waves(strength: 9.25, speed: 5, rotation: -45).write(o0)

The ``media()`` step reads the external texture. Whatever comes after it is a GPU filter chain. Adding a new effect means adding one line to an array.

The 3x3 grid works by creating nine ``CanvasRenderer`` instances that all read from the same ``<video>`` element. Each one compiles a different DSL program. Switching tabs recompiles all nine in parallel with a different set of effects.

The whole app is 1,200 lines of vanilla JavaScript. The Noisemaker integration wrapper is 130 lines.
