"""Stroboscopic detection against the WCAG 2.3.1 general flash threshold.

Photosensitive seizure risk is a published standard, not a matter of taste, so
this module implements the bar rather than a tuned sensitivity:

  * A *flash* is a **pair** of opposing changes in relative luminance of at
    least ``FLASH_DELTA``, where the darker of the two states sits below
    ``DARK_THRESHOLD``. A 3 Hz square wave is three flashes per second and six
    transitions per second; counting transitions doubles the rate and is the
    easy mistake here.
  * Content fails at **more than** ``MAX_FLASHES_PER_SECOND`` flashes in any
    one-second window.
  * The flashing region must cover a meaningful part of the field of view.
    WCAG expresses this as 25% of a 10-degree field; a full-frame generative
    animation approximates that with ``MIN_FLASHING_AREA`` of an evenly tiled
    grid.

The area rule does the real work. Averaging luminance over the whole frame
understates a strobe badly: a reference clip that flashes every block at 8 Hz
measured only 3.0 flashes per second as a whole-frame mean, which does not
clear the threshold on its own.
