# Out-of-Band Ledger

Some layers of the platform are allowed to lag behind feature work: the
primary development pass ships the feature, and a separate catch-up pass
tops these layers off later. This file is the checkpoint record for those
passes.

Each section records:

- **Checkpoint** — the commit (SHA, date) through which the category is
  known to be caught up. "Caught up through X" describes what was audited,
  not where the fix landed. Cross-repo categories list one checkpoint per
  repo.
- **Scope** — what the pass owns.
- **Gap detection** — how to compute outstanding work since the checkpoint.
- **Log** — one line per completed pass, newest first.

Running a catch-up pass: compute the gap over `<checkpoint>..HEAD`, do the
work, verify it, then update the checkpoint and append a log line.

## I18n strings

- **Checkpoint:** noisemaker `45a34489` (2026-07-10)
- **Scope:** the translation catalogs
  `shaders/effects/strings.{de,es,fr,it,ja,pt}.json`. The English catalog
  `strings.en.json` is generated from effect definitions (`npm run strings`)
  and drift-tested by `npm run test:shaders:i18n`, so it never lags and is
  not part of this pass. Missing locale keys fall back to English at
  runtime, so gaps are invisible without the diff below.
- **Gap detection:** every key present in `strings.en.json` and absent from
  a locale file needs a translation. From `shaders/effects/`:

  ```
  node -e 'const fs=require("fs");const en=Object.keys(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("strings.en.json","utf8")));for(const l of["de","es","fr","it","ja","pt"]){const t=new Set(Object.keys(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("strings."+l+".json","utf8"))));const m=en.filter(k=>!t.has(k));if(m.length)console.log(l+":",m.join(", "))}'
  ```

  Keys stay in the same (sorted) order as the English catalog. Match each
  locale's existing conventions — parameter labels lowercase, effect names
  capitalized, description tone per locale — and reuse the file's existing
  translation for a term before inventing a new one.
- **Log:**
  - 2026-07-10 — initial top-off, 37 strings: `filter/parallax` block
    (5 keys, de/fr/it/ja/pt), `filter/dither.type.errorDiffusion` and
    `filter/lighting.heightMap` (all six locales).

## Large-format tiling

- **Checkpoint:** noisemaker `45a34489` / noisedeck `75262325` (preview
  branch), 2026-07-10
- **Scope:** every effect must be classified for Noisedeck's large-format
  (tiled print) export. Tile-aware effects consume the global `tileOffset`
  and `fullResolution` uniforms in both GLSL and WGSL (packed WGSL layouts
  may need explicit `uniformLayout` slots). Effects that cannot render
  tiled belong in one of noisedeck's deny-lists:
  `app/js/utils/hasStatefulEffects.js` (state textures cannot re-render at
  print resolution) or `app/js/utils/hasUpscaleOnlyEffects.js` (would seam
  at the 1024 px tile overlap). An effect in none of the three states
  silently produces seamed prints.
- **Gap detection:** list effects added since the checkpoint
  (`git log --diff-filter=A --name-only <checkpoint>..HEAD -- 'shaders/effects/*/*/definition.js'`)
  and classify each: make it tile-aware, or route it into the appropriate
  deny-list. Verify tile-aware claims with noisedeck's seam harness
  (`tests/large-format-seams/`).
- **Log:**
  - 2026-07-10 — post-ship catch-up: parallax tile-clamped + synth WGSL
    ports (noisemaker `45a34489`); effects added since ship routed into
    deny-lists, seam-harness hardening (noisedeck `a12ee01e`..`75262325`).
  - 2026-05-16 — feature shipped (noisemaker `f1b0a919`, noisedeck
    `913b722b`).

## Documentation

- **Checkpoint:** noisemaker `45a34489` (2026-07-10)
- **Scope:** the Sphinx docs under `docs/` (published to docs.noisemaker.app
  by `.github/workflows/docs-site.yml`) and the per-effect
  `shaders/effects/*/*/help.md` files rendered by the live Effect Reference.
  `help.md` is normally written in-band with the effect; this pass catches
  stragglers and decides which shipped features merit a narrative guide.
- **Gap detection:**
  1. Effects missing `help.md`: compare `shaders/effects/*/*/definition.js`
     against the corresponding `help.md` paths.
  2. Features shipped since the checkpoint that merit a guide under
     `docs/shaders/features.rst` (pattern: `docs/shaders/cubemaps.rst`).
  3. Narrative statements invalidated by recent commits (grep the affected
     terms in `docs/`).
- **Log:**
  - 2026-07-10 — initial catch-up: added `help.md` for
    `mixer/channelCombine` and `filter/temporalAberration`; added feature
    guides for parallax, the 3D pipeline, and mashup.

## AI development contract (llms-full.txt)

- **Checkpoint:** noisemaker `75507112` / shade-mcp `7fd0d975`, 2026-07-14
- **Scope:** the hand-authored agent contract `llms-full.txt` — the
  executable-source companion served at the site root that describes
  *current* runtime behavior across nine surfaces (DSL, effect definition,
  parameters/globals, passes/graph, textures, compatibility/mutation,
  rendered output, cross-backend parity, Shade MCP tool contracts), a fully
  worked validated effect, the surface × capability traceability matrix, and
  the gap register (GAP-001..026). The file pins its own audited SHAs in the
  "Source snapshots used for this contract" block at its head; that block and
  this checkpoint are the same two SHAs and must be advanced together. There
  is no generator — every update is a hand edit verified against live source.
  The short public index `llms.txt` carries no pinned snapshot and is kept
  current in-band with its links, so it is not part of this pass.
- **Gap detection:**
  1. Noisemaker drift — commits since the noisemaker checkpoint touching the
     primary source roots the contract reads:

     ```
     git log --oneline 75507112..HEAD -- shaders/src/lang/ shaders/src/runtime/ shaders/src/renderer/canvas.js shaders/tests/test-harness.js
     ```

     Each can invalidate a behavior statement, typed grammar, or validator
     message, or change a gap's status. Re-audit the affected surface
     section(s) and re-check every gap whose "Source evidence" file changed.
  2. Shade MCP drift (GAP-013) — `.mcp.json` runs
     `npx -y github:noisedeck/shade-mcp` unpinned. Re-resolve it to its current
     commit; if it moved off the pinned shade-mcp SHA, re-capture `tools/list`
     (tool count and signatures) and the `shade-mcp` server/protocol version
     triple, then re-audit the "Shade MCP tool contracts" section and the
     MCP-side gaps.
- **Log:**
  - 2026-07-14 — contract instrumented (`dc67827b`) at snapshot noisemaker
    `75507112` / shade-mcp `7fd0d975`: nine surface sections, worked validated
    effect, 9×4 traceability matrix, 26-gap register. Audited clean through
    `478989b6`; checkpoint established at the contract's own snapshot.
