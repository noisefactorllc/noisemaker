# Out-of-Band Ledger

Some layers of the platform are allowed to lag behind feature work: the
primary development pass ships the feature, and a separate catch-up pass
tops these layers off later. This file is the checkpoint record for those
passes.

Each section records:

- **Checkpoint** — the commit (SHA, date) through which the category is
  known to be caught up. "Caught up through X" describes what was audited,
  not where the fix landed. Cross-repo categories list one checkpoint per
  repo.
- **Scope** — what the pass owns.
- **Gap detection** — how to compute outstanding work since the checkpoint.
- **Log** — one line per completed pass, newest first.

Running a catch-up pass: compute the gap over `<checkpoint>..HEAD`, do the
work, verify it, then update the checkpoint and append a log line.

## I18n strings

- **Checkpoint:** noisemaker `d30d1045` / noisedeck `94f4d002` (2026-09-07)
- **Scope:** two translation surfaces:
  - Noisemaker effect catalogs
    `shaders/effects/strings.{de,es,fr,it,ja,pt}.json`. The English catalog
    `strings.en.json` is generated from effect definitions (`npm run strings`)
    and drift-tested by `npm run test:shaders:i18n`.
  - Noisedeck UI catalogs under
    `app/js/i18n/locales/{de,es,fr,it,ja,pt}/`. The matching `en/` slices are
    the hand-authored source of truth.
  Missing locale keys fall back to English at runtime, so gaps on both
  surfaces are invisible without the checks below.
- **Gap detection:**
  1. Noisemaker — every key present in `strings.en.json` and absent from a
     locale file needs a translation. From `shaders/effects/`:

     ```
     node -e 'const fs=require("fs");const en=Object.keys(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("strings.en.json","utf8")));for(const l of["de","es","fr","it","ja","pt"]){const t=new Set(Object.keys(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("strings."+l+".json","utf8"))));const m=en.filter(k=>!t.has(k));if(m.length)console.log(l+":",m.join(", "))}'
     ```

     Keys stay in the same (sorted) order as the English catalog. Match each
     locale's existing conventions — parameter labels lowercase, effect names
     capitalized, description tone per locale — and reuse the file's existing
     translation for a term before inventing a new one. Run
     `npm run test:shaders:i18n` to enforce exact key order and non-empty values
     across all six translated catalogs, in addition to generated-English drift
     and runtime fallback behavior.
  2. Noisedeck — from its repository root, run the catalog-parity test. Its
     diff names every missing or extra leaf key by locale:

     ```
     node --test --test-timeout=60000 tests/i18n.node-test.js
     ```

     Add keys to the matching area slice in English order. The test enforces
     non-empty string values plus every placeholder, plural leaf, and markup tag
     from the English catalog.
- **Log:**
  - 2026-09-07 — caught up through noisemaker `d30d1045` / noisedeck
    `94f4d002`: audited all 20 live-capture settings, status, permission,
    recording-limit, and export-warning strings; all six UI translations
    were already complete. All six effect catalogs retain all 3,639 English
    keys. Generated-English drift, key order, placeholders, markup, fallback,
    and locale checks passed, along with Noisedeck's full 806-test Node suite
    and both affected toolbar/settings browser tests. No catalog edits were
    required.
  - 2026-09-07 — caught up through noisemaker `d30d1045` / noisedeck
    `00cb87d2`: all six effect catalogs contain all 3,639 English keys.
    Audited the new Remap editor and MIDI CC, NRPN, MPE, and audio-channel
    copy plus the removed Sync retry string; all six UI locales were already
    complete. Generated-English drift, exact key order, non-empty values,
    placeholders, markup, fallback, and async locale checks passed, as did
    Noisedeck's full 806-test Node suite. No catalog edits were required.
  - 2026-09-03 — caught up through noisemaker `691eea16` / noisedeck
    `0f3917fb`: verified that the updated Cell description is present in all six
    translated effect catalogs and that Noisedeck's insert-zone, MIDI-device,
    and audio-device strings are translated in all six UI locales. Revalidated
    exact key order, non-empty values, placeholders, markup, generated-English
    drift, runtime fallback, and async locale selection; no catalog edits were
    required in this pass.
  - 2026-08-31 — caught up through noisemaker `c38316a1` / noisedeck
    `114d64f7`: Noisemaker's generated English catalog and all six translated
    effect catalogs remained complete. Noisedeck's translations for unloaded
    user effects, storage save failures, and paid-feature load failures were
    present in all six locales; revalidated exact key parity, non-empty values,
    placeholders, markup, and async locale selection. No catalog edits were
    required in this pass.
  - 2026-08-29 — caught up through noisemaker `19c15cc0` / noisedeck
    `eb3c3de6`: Noisemaker's generated English catalog and all six translated
    effect catalogs were already complete; added 312 Noisedeck translations
    (52 new UI leaves in each of six locales) for shader-pipeline export,
    collaboration, completion, save-failure, and unloaded-user-effect copy.
    Added durable Noisemaker key-order/non-empty-value checks and Noisedeck
    key-order, non-empty-value, placeholder, and markup integrity checks.
  - 2026-08-19 — caught up through `1ee891a2`: audited the i18n
    catch-up range; the English catalog was unchanged and all six locale
    catalogs remain complete, so no additional translations were needed in
    this pass.
  - 2026-08-14 — caught up through `712ac2cf`: audited the i18n
    catch-up range; the English catalog was unchanged and all six locale
    catalogs are now complete, so no additional translations were needed in
    this pass.
  - 2026-08-14 — catch-up, 1,566 strings: 261 missing keys across all six
    locales, covering the new and expanded `filter/chrome` through
    `filter/wind` effect blocks.
  - 2026-07-10 — initial top-off, 37 strings: `filter/parallax` block
    (5 keys, de/fr/it/ja/pt), `filter/dither.type.errorDiffusion` and
    `filter/lighting.heightMap` (all six locales).

## Large-format tiling

- **Checkpoint:** noisemaker `827b2e91` / noisedeck `539ee089` (preview
  branch), 2026-09-07
- **Scope:** every effect must be classified for Noisedeck's large-format
  (tiled print) export. Tile-aware effects consume the global `tileOffset`
  and `fullResolution` uniforms in both GLSL and WGSL when their coordinates
  depend on the full canvas (packed WGSL layouts may need explicit
  `uniformLayout` slots); purely local kernels are also safe when their
  maximum source footprint fits inside the 1024 px overlap. Effects that
  cannot render tiled belong in one of noisedeck's deny-lists:
  `app/js/utils/hasStatefulEffects.js` (state textures cannot re-render at
  print resolution) or `app/js/utils/hasUpscaleOnlyEffects.js` (would seam
  at the 1024 px tile overlap). An effect in none of the three states
  silently produces seamed prints.
- **Gap detection:** list effects added since the checkpoint
  (`git log --diff-filter=A --name-only <checkpoint>..HEAD -- 'shaders/effects/*/*/definition.js'`)
  and classify each: make it tile-aware, or route it into the appropriate
  deny-list. Verify tile-aware claims with noisedeck's seam harness
  (`tests/large-format-seams/`).
- **Log:**
  - 2026-09-07 — caught up through noisemaker `827b2e91`: no new effects;
    rechecked the changed Remap definition and Text shader. Remap's active
    zones exposed a GLSL seam: source surfaces are tile-local, but sampling
    used global UV. Corrected the source lookup to use the packed resolution
    slot; polygon coordinates remain global and WGSL already uses local
    source sampling. Remap now has a zero-pixel source displacement and needs
    no deny-list entry. Both backends match full-frame captures exactly at
    2048x2048 and 2048x3000 using Noisedeck's seam harness; four untiled
    before/after captures remain byte-identical. Added a nontrivial active-zone
    regression, renewed source-bound strict Remap parity evidence, and passed
    33 tile checks, 126 harness/classifier tests, Shade compilation/structure,
    and the full non-parity JS suite. Text's external-overlay tile regression
    also passes. No Noisedeck routing changes were required.

  - 2026-09-04 — caught up through noisemaker `ee523ab9` / noisedeck
    `539ee089`: audited 25 added artistic filters and seven changed effect
    definitions. Classified 23 additions as tile-safe, routed `spinBlur` and
    `pondRipples` to the upscale-only path, and kept `extrude` tiled with a
    pinned 768 px maximum source-dependency bound. Repaired `text` WGSL to
    sample its external overlay in global output space and added a behavioral
    WebGPU full-frame/offset-tile regression. Stopped Noisedeck's animation
    loop during controlled captures to eliminate a WebGPU harness race and
    consolidated the diagnostic deny-list onto the production-synced mirror.
    Revalidated 124 harness/classifier tests, 31 cross-backend tile checks,
    all 203 shader structures, and the full shader-language suite; no stateful
    routing changes were required.
  - 2026-07-10 — post-ship catch-up: parallax tile-clamped + synth WGSL
    ports (noisemaker `45a34489`); effects added since ship routed into
    deny-lists, seam-harness hardening (noisedeck `a12ee01e`..`75262325`).
  - 2026-05-16 — feature shipped (noisemaker `f1b0a919`, noisedeck
    `913b722b`).

## Documentation

- **Checkpoint:** noisemaker `d30d1045` (2026-09-07)
- **Scope:** the Sphinx docs under `docs/` (published to docs.noisemaker.app
  by `.github/workflows/docs-site.yml`) and the per-effect
  `shaders/effects/*/*/help.md` files rendered by the live Effect Reference.
  `help.md` is normally written in-band with the effect; this pass catches
  stragglers and decides which shipped features merit a narrative guide.
- **Gap detection:**
  1. Effects missing `help.md`: compare `shaders/effects/*/*/definition.js`
     against the corresponding `help.md` paths.
  2. Features shipped since the checkpoint that merit a guide under
     `docs/shaders/features.rst` (pattern: `docs/shaders/cubemaps.rst`).
  3. Narrative statements invalidated by recent commits (grep the affected
     terms in `docs/`).
- **Log:**
  - 2026-09-07 — caught up through `d30d1045`: verified help coverage for
    all 210 effects and 1,223 documented parameters across the 200 effects
    recognized by the table checker. Documented lossless Remap vertex
    formatting in the language, effect-authoring, and effect-help references.
    Re-audited the in-band MIDI CC, CC14, NRPN, MPE, audio-channel, and capture
    capability guides; no additional feature guide was needed. The existing
    non-parity suite, six Remap round-trip tests, and four static-asset checks
    passed. The production-format Sphinx dirhtml build passed with 18 warnings
    in unchanged documentation and configuration.
  - 2026-09-04 — caught up through `acb26f80`: verified `help.md`
    file coverage for all 210 effect definitions and ran the existing
    parameter-table checker across the 200 definitions it recognizes. Corrected
    the affected shader-language narrative for mandatory namespace search,
    built-in I/O, current generators and namespaces, and schema-valid argument
    and partial-application examples. Aligned the compiler guide with its actual
    parse, validate, expand, allocate, graph-assembly, backend-compilation, and
    error contracts, and removed the same obsolete DAG, synthetic-texture,
    pass-field, and runtime-shape claims from the pipeline and effect-authoring
    guides. No effect or user-facing feature was added, so no new narrative
    guide was required. Revalidated the production `dirhtml` Sphinx build and
    static-document asset checks.
  - 2026-09-04 — caught up through `8cad384f`: verified `help.md`
    file coverage for all 210 effect definitions and ran the existing
    parameter-table checker across the 200 definitions it recognizes. Audited
    the documentation-only range: its refreshed AI development contract and
    corrected oscillator, normalized automation, selected-device, raw-audio,
    and nested-automation language are already reflected in the existing
    shader guides. No effect or user-facing feature was added, so no new
    narrative guide was required. Revalidated the production `dirhtml` Sphinx
    build and static-document asset checks.
  - 2026-09-04 — caught up through `5b0b7aa7`: verified `help.md`
    file coverage for all 210 effect definitions and ran the existing
    parameter-table checker across the 200 definitions it recognizes. Updated
    the existing CLI, general DSL language, and shader guides
    for strobe verdicts, magic-mashup input gating, normalized and nested
    MIDI/audio automation,
    selected external devices, raw audio, external-state exports, device-bound
    3D volume sizing, and MRT precision fallback. The remaining dependency,
    ledger, localization, and tiled-text changes did not require another
    narrative guide. Revalidated the production `dirhtml` Sphinx build and
    static-document asset checks.
  - 2026-08-19 — caught up through `1ee891a2`: verified `help.md`
    coverage for all 210 effects and audited the shader-parity attestation
    infrastructure, PixelSort parity repair, JS/Python parity corrections,
    fixture tooling, and dependency updates in the range; updated the release
    workflow narrative for the new CPU parity-attestation gate, while no new
    effect or user-facing feature required an additional feature guide.
  - 2026-08-14 — caught up through `24c7053c`: verified `help.md`
    coverage for all 210 effects and audited the renderer-output guide and
    navigation links, i18n catalogs, AI contract, CI, and vendored tooling in
    the range; the existing guide covers the only Sphinx-relevant feature, so
    no additional narrative changes were needed in this pass.
  - 2026-08-14 — caught up through `0d34e10d`: verified `help.md`
    coverage for all 210 effects, added the renderer-output guide for sinks
    and bounded asynchronous frame export, and audited the in-band export-kit,
    static-site, effect-authoring, and repository-link changes; no other
    Sphinx narrative was invalidated.
  - 2026-08-11 — caught up through `f33b5bfb`: verified `help.md`
    coverage for all 210 effects and audited the AI development contract
    refresh plus the prior documentation catch-up; neither shipped a shader
    feature nor invalidated Sphinx narrative, so no guide or narrative edits
    were needed.
  - 2026-08-11 — caught up through `7cc4894b`: verified `help.md`
    coverage for all 210 effects, corrected the remaining stale pre-move
    repository URL in the CLI help snapshot, and audited the Playwright and
    Ruff dependency bumps; no additional shader feature guides needed.
  - 2026-08-10 — caught up through `7cdf2b6d`: verified `help.md`
    coverage for all 210 effects (including 25 effects added since the
    checkpoint), corrected four stale pre-move noisemaker repository links,
    and audited the in-band coding-agents guide plus runtime fixes; no
    additional shader feature guides needed.
  - 2026-07-10 — initial catch-up: added `help.md` for
    `mixer/channelCombine` and `filter/temporalAberration`; added feature
    guides for parallax, the 3D pipeline, and mashup.

## AI development contract (llms-full.txt)

- **Checkpoint:** noisemaker `246ff57f` / shade-mcp `0a92bd83`, 2026-09-07
- **Scope:** the hand-authored agent contract `llms-full.txt` — the
  executable-source companion served at the site root that describes
  *current* runtime behavior across nine surfaces (DSL, effect definition,
  parameters/globals, passes/graph, textures, compatibility/mutation,
  rendered output, cross-backend parity, Shade MCP tool contracts), a fully
  worked validated effect, the surface × capability traceability matrix, and
  the 30-entry open gap register (GAP-001..017, GAP-019..024, and
  GAP-026..032). The file pins its
  own audited SHAs in the "Source snapshots used for this contract" block at
  its head; that block and this checkpoint are the same two SHAs and must be
  advanced together. There is no generator — every update is a hand edit
  verified against live source.
  The short public index `llms.txt` carries no pinned snapshot and is kept
  current in-band with its links, so it is not part of this pass.
- **Gap detection:**
  1. Noisemaker drift — commits since the noisemaker checkpoint touching the
     primary source roots the contract reads:

     ```
     git log --oneline 246ff57f..HEAD -- shaders/src/lang/ shaders/src/runtime/ shaders/src/renderer/canvas.js shaders/tests/test-harness.js
     ```

     Each can invalidate a behavior statement, typed grammar, or validator
     message, or change a gap's status. Re-audit the affected surface
     section(s) and re-check every gap whose "Source evidence" file changed.
  2. Shade MCP drift (GAP-013) — `.mcp.json` runs
     `npx -y github:noisedeck/shade-mcp` unpinned. Re-resolve it to its current
     commit; if it moved off the pinned shade-mcp SHA, re-capture `tools/list`
     (tool count and signatures) and the `shade-mcp` server/protocol version
     triple, then re-audit the "Shade MCP tool contracts" section and the
     MCP-side gaps.
- **Log:**
  - 2026-09-07 — caught up through noisemaker `246ff57f` / shade-mcp
    `0a92bd83`: documented lossless vec4 formatting, CC/CC14, NRPN, pressure,
    bend, MPE selection, port inventories/lifecycle, default audio channels,
    and aggregate/raw cleanup. Narrowed GAP-031 to legacy note modes, extended
    GAP-032 to default channels, and closed GAP-018 after the tool descriptions
    stopped promising glob support. Rechecked changed-source engine and MCP
    gaps. Resolved the runtime mirror to the pinned Shade commit, built its
    locked dependencies, and captured the 0.2.2/2025-11-25 handshake, all 18
    schemas, and eight worked calls in one session. Tool descriptions and error
    strings changed; argument types/defaults did not. The exact two-pass source
    graph reproduced, while the compile reports still demonstrate GAP-024.
    Noisemaker language/runtime and focused MIDI suites passed; Shade's 157
    tests, typecheck, build, and standalone-drop checks passed.
  - 2026-09-04 — caught up through noisemaker `691eea16` / shade-mcp
    `23258ca3`: re-audited selected MIDI ports, selected audio device/channels,
    bipolar raw audio, recursive capture requirements, and eight-level nested
    automation across the changed parser, validator, unparser, external-input,
    and pipeline sources. Added the exact mixed-argument exception, selector
    validation/round-trip contract, runtime state resolution, nested-field
    ranges and deterministic phase integration, and host capture requirements.
    Opened GAP-031 for the unenforced MIDI channel range and GAP-032 because the
    built-in audio manager cannot populate selected-device or raw-ready state;
    rechecked the other changed-source gaps without closing them. Re-resolved
    the configured GitHub runtime to `23258ca3`, whose drift is README-only,
    and recaptured the `shade-mcp`/`0.2.2`/`2025-11-25` handshake and all 18
    unchanged tool schemas in one fresh session. Recaptured all eight worked
    calls and reproduced the exact two-pass source graph. The returned
    responsiveness fields do not belong to `synth/testPattern`, strengthening
    GAP-024's stale-graph finding rather than validating that response.
  - 2026-08-31 — caught up through noisemaker `a4701daf` / shade-mcp
    `ba407982`: verified that Noisemaker's watched source roots are unchanged
    from the prior checkpoint, re-resolved the unpinned GitHub package to the
    exact Shade MCP commit, and recaptured the
    `shade-mcp`/`0.2.2`/`2025-06-18` handshake and all 18 tool signatures from
    the configured runtime. The tool names, input schemas, absent output
    schemas, and forbidden task support are unchanged. Audited the Shade MCP
    dependency/release changes and documented its build-time version injection
    plus standalone-drop handshake gate; its tests, typecheck, build, external
    dependency gate, and bare-drop check all passed. Rechecked every MCP-side
    gap; none closed. Recaptured the full eight-call worked transcript in the
    same `0.2.2` session; the seven deterministic responses were byte-for-byte
    unchanged, the FPS sample still passed its threshold, and the results
    continue to expose GAP-024 rather than proving end-to-end backend identity.
    The source-level worked program also reproduced its exact two-pass graph.
  - 2026-08-29 — caught up through noisemaker `c767e481` / shade-mcp
    `ac4c6ba1`: re-audited the two watched device-limit commits and documented
    the expanded capability object, numeric volume-atlas clamping across graph,
    host, and UI paths, WebGL MRT budget probing/error cleanup, and ordered
    full-to-half-float MRT adaptation across WebGL2/WebGPU. Rechecked the
    changed-source evidence for GAP-001/004/005/006/007/016/026; none closed.
    Opened GAP-030 because MRT adaptation mutates graph formats without
    invalidating same-size reused backend textures. Reproduced the worked source
    graph and device-limit regression gates. Shade MCP did not move in this
    Tearoff range, so its handshake, 18 tool schemas, historical browser
    transcript, and MCP-side gaps remain pinned unchanged.
  - 2026-08-14 — caught up through noisemaker `f6b22ab3` / shade-mcp
    `ac4c6ba1`: verified that no Noisemaker watched source root changed,
    re-resolved the unpinned MCP package, and recaptured the
    `shade-mcp`/`0.2.1`/`2025-06-18` handshake, all 18 tool schemas, the exact
    two-pass source graph, and the eight-call worked transcript. Re-audited
    the affected MCP contract sources and every MCP-side gap; documented the
    configurable browser/AI timeouts, headless/session lifecycle, restricted
    loopback/opaque-origin CORS, opt-in description image, refreshable effect
    index, and manifest invalidation, narrowed GAP-020 now that pixel parity
    also uses the shared `isError` wrapper, and opened GAP-029 for invalidation
    racing an already in-flight index rebuild.
  - 2026-08-11 — caught up through noisemaker `e1feefa0` / shade-mcp
    `346ee022`: documented the renderer sink and bounded asynchronous frame
    export contracts across WebGL2/WebGPU, rechecked every changed-source gap,
    and opened GAP-028 for pending accepted frames canceled without a terminal
    queue result. Re-resolved the unpinned MCP package; recaptured the
    `shade-mcp`/`0.1.4`/`2025-06-18` handshake, all 18 tool schemas, and the
    eight-call worked transcript after the Node 22/SDK/Zod upgrades.
  - 2026-08-10 — caught up through noisemaker `7cc4894b` / shade-mcp
    `3e531fc6`: re-audited Noisemaker runtime drift; re-resolved the unpinned
    MCP package; recaptured the `shade-mcp`/`0.1.4`/`2025-06-18` handshake,
    all 18 tool signatures, and the worked transcript; narrowed GAP-020 for
    the new whole-call `isError` marker; closed GAP-025.
  - 2026-07-14 — contract instrumented (`dc67827b`) at snapshot noisemaker
    `75507112` / shade-mcp `7fd0d975`: nine surface sections, worked validated
    effect, 9×4 traceability matrix, 26-gap register. Audited clean through
    `478989b6`; checkpoint established at the contract's own snapshot.
